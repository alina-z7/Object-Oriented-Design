## About

Welcome to my COMP 313 repository! As a student who has completed the course, this collection demonstrates my understanding of object-oriented programming principles, design patterns, Android app development, and Java programming skills.

## Description

This repository showcases projects, samples, and code related to COMP 313, providing insights into object-oriented programming concepts, design patterns, and practical Java programming.

## Learning Outcomes

Upon completing COMP 313, I have achieved the following:

Thorough understanding of object-oriented programming principles
Application of basic design patterns
Proficiency in Java programming, with a focus on collections and generics
Topics Covered
Object-Oriented Programming Principles
Design Patterns
Java Programming with Collections and Generics
Android Development Basics
Additional Object-Oriented Design Principles

## Principles Of Object-Oriented Design

SOLID Principles

SRP (Single Responsibility Principle): A class should have only one reason to change.
OCP (Open Closed Principle): Software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification.
LSP (Liskov Substitution Principle): Objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of its subclasses without affecting the functionality.
ISP (Interface Segregation Principle): Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use.
DIP (Dependency Inversion Principle): High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.
Package Cohesion Principles

REP (Reuse/Release Equivalence Principle): The granularity of reuse is the same as the granularity of release.
CCP (Common Closure Principle): Classes that change together are packaged together.
CRP (Common Reuse Principle): Classes that are used together are packaged together.
Package Coupling Principles

ADP (Acyclic Dependencies Principle): The dependency graph of packages should have no cycles.
SDP (Stable Dependencies Principle): Depend in the direction of stability.
SAP (Stable Abstractions Principle): A package should be as abstract as it is stable.
